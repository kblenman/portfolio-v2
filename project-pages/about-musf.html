				<h2>About the Project</h2>

			<div class="tj pt4 pb4 pl4 pr4 lh-copy pl6-l pr6-l">
				<p>For my senior project, I took what I learned from Andrei Neagoie's Udemy course and created a group matching system. The overall goal of the project was to create a system that would have students fill out a form with their preferences and use that information to automatically suggest compatible project groups for the instructor based on said forms. In this case, the project was created specifically to group students that are taking the IT Senior Project course.</p>

				<p>The main page of the application is where students are able to fill out a form which allows them to state when they are typically available, choose 3 projects they would like to be placed in from greatest to least priority, and submit their form. The form will not submit and display an error message if the first and last name fields are blank or if there is a duplicated project choice.</p>

				<p>Once all students have submitted their forms, the teacher/administrator can then sign into the administrator portal where they can view the current submitted forms and press the 'Create Groups' button which runs the grouping algorithm and displays a list of suggested groups.</p>

				<h3 class="b underline">About the Algorithm</h3>
				<p>The grouping algorithm creates groups of 3 or 4 (max) based on compatible availability time and project choice. It attempts to assign students to their first choices first then filters down choice levels from there until most students have been assigned to a group. Students that were not able to be assigned are then added to a final "Unassigned Students" group. More than likely, students in this group either picked projects that had little demand or they were not be able to be placed in an existing group matching their availability time because the group was already full. From there, the instructor can contact and/or manually place them into another group, overriding the group size limit or availability constraint at their own discretion.</p>
